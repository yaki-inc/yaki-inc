AI means love. We build human-centric AI apps.

This is the public repository for Yaki, Inc.'s Open Source Software. At Yaki, we develop applications that keep privacy and encryption front and center,
and to push the cause of End-to-End Encryption across the web, we have come up with bespoke Authentication and Authorization protocols, viz. CAKE and YEP,
that enable OAuth like capabilities for the encrypted web that still guarantee user privacy, and also host a authentication provider to go along with them
@ https://E2E2.me. You can learn more about the protocols and E2E2.me at https://E2E2.org

_Coming soon!_ This repository will contain two main libraries, both written in Typescript:
1. `yaki-crypto` - A typesafe cryptography library built atop the battle-tested `tweetnacl` library, that makes symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) dead simple. In addition, it also implements the CAKE and YEP protocols.
2. `e2e2-client` - A simple library to interact with the authn/authz provider at E2E2.me.

Yaki, Inc. is also the creator of https://Datayaki.com, a privacy-first data analytics platform that relies on these libraries.
